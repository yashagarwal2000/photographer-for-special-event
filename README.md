# Photographer_Website

# Summary 
TThis was a personal project I decided to do for myself after I recieved my front-end developer certificate. I wanted to incorporate all
of the skills I learned within 5 months of bootcamp. The difference was I decided to link boostrap which made it easier for me
when it came to the price page. I loved the theme colors which was automatic with the pictures I found on pexel.com. I wanted to 
really add more of a masculine feel to the website since this is about a fictional photographer from London who creates
beautiful profile pictures of people/model using white and black.

### Description/ walk-through
At first glance, the image of a he photographer will capture your eye. Literally seeming as thought he is about to take a picture of anyone
that is on his website. But this gives a direct messsage as to what he does for a living and what his business it about.
I wanted to keep the layouts of each page since the main focus was the information and "his talent". But I wanted to add a pop of color, neon green,
just to add another touch to the basic red and purple theme colors.

The about page show cases "his work" of beautiful profile pictures and the title of the work. On the price page is explanatory giving three different options and what those options consist of if so the customer chooses. Within each price range
offers certain themes, colors, and picture frame layouts.

The cool thing about the navigation is when the mouse hover overs each page option, the words go from white to blue and then 
there is a red line that appears which is the website's theme colors.

#### Software used:
Adobe Dreamweaver (text-editor) and VS Code (text-editor)

#### What I learn:
I learn that I can use Bootstrap as an alternative from Flexbox to get the job done quicker regarding how the layout changes from mobile to desktop.

##### Challenges to improve on
1. Flexbox is a challenge which I need to work on more.
2. How to keep the navigation consistent throughout each page.

##### Solutions/solving the issue:

1. Use the Inspect Tool
